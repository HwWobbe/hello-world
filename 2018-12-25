This repo can hold a TW5 file? It’s name suggests so, based on what I’ve seen of other instances.

    the file (type) may be a reqirement

    review the most recent documentation findings
    try this with 5.1.18, now that it has been released.
    consider the use of MaarfaPad, if it can be accessed via its URL.
    pursue this with Bob, but not until after MultiUser decvelopments are complete
    consider making this a nodeJs *tid based instance, especially if an external *.tid store evolves
    try uploading a TW5 file to repo ( as a first step )

    try forking an existing TW
    consider hosting options …
    TiddlySpot ( may be easiest )
    Azure hosting, with just a link from here, especially if it can run a nodeJs instance

    this could have developer access that someone like Arlen could setup
    Private repos are apparently only available to Premium ($7/month) users

This is now a new file in the Hello-world repo.
