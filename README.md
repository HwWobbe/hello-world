# hello-world
Just a preliminary comment ... AboutMe:  I use TiddlyWiki a lot!

Now it's time to start setting up some repositories for my TW files.
But one initial hurdle is decxiding if I should use a loca Git version that syncs back.


For the moment ...

I am making a few related notes in the wiki.

I am watching the reports of my activity to ensure that I have an adequate understanding of how to work in this environment.
