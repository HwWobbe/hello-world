# HelloWorld
This "Hello-world repo(sitory) started VERY slowly with just my activities at GitHub.  Now, I am considering it as a personal portal for more of my internet activities, as well as my rapidly growing intranet (that now includes RaspberryPi components as well as the usual mix of w-Intel, Android and iOS systems).

<h3> GitHub </h3>
Perhaps I should choose the Branch ... Merge ... PR work flow (instead of doing direct edits).

* Step through the tutorial again, making careful procedure notes
* I've noticed I can edit this content directly, but when I try to use the GitHub GUI, I get a version that is out-of-date.
* But one initial hurdle is which Git desktop version that syncs back, to choose.
* Later it will be time to start setting up some repositories for my TW files.
