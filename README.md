This "Hello-world repo(ository) contains my (slowly growing) activities at GitHub.

<h2> About me ...</h2>

Just a preliminary comment ... <br>
.. I use wiki(s) a LOT; especially TiddlyWik! <br>
.... PdWorks (especially for Tasks) <br>
.... Diigo Outliners https://www.diigo.com/user/hanswobbe <br>

.. It's way past time to update my image. <br>

<h3> Current (GIT novice) issues ... </h3>

* For now, use the wiki(s) for "just text" to reduce frivolus Commits.
* In the mean time, continue relying on DropBox & exploring other options.
* I remain focused on Content creation (not program enhancements)
* considering frequent Commits, if only to force focused attention (weekly Activity indicator)
* beginning to realize the importance of extending this GitHub profile towards my goal of providing a central, reliable comprehensive introduction

<h3> GitGub </h3>
Perhaps I should choose the Branch ... Merge ... PR work flow (instead of doing direct edits).

* Step through the tutorial again, making careful procedure notes
* I've noticed I can edit this content directly, but when I try to use the GitHub GUI, I get a version that is out-of-date.
* But one initial hurdle is which Git desktop version that syncs back, to choose.
* Later it will be time to start setting up some repositories for my TW files.
