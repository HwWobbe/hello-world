# hello-world
Just a preliminary comment ... 
... AboutMe:  I use TiddlyWiki a lot!

Current (novice) issues ...
* I've noticed that I can edit this content directly, but when I try to use the GitHub GUI, I seem to get a version that is out-of-date.
* Make sure to use local versions that sync (in case of CloudLoss)
* For now, use the wiki(s) for "just text" to reduce frivolus Commits.
* make a weekly Commit, if only as an activity indicator.
* I have uploaded a file, but I am not sure where it went.
* ...

Perhaps I should choose the Branch ... Merge ... PR work flow (instead of doing direct edits).

* Step through the tutorial again, making careful procedure notes
* Later it will be time to start setting up some repositories for my TW files.
* But one initial hurdle is which Git desktop version that syncs back, to choose.
* Check StackOverflow too
