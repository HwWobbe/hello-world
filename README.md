# HelloWorld
This "Hello-world" repo(sitory) is morphing slowly with just my activities at GitHub.  Now, it is progressing as I consider it as key personal portal for more of my internet activities, as well as my growing intranet (that now includes RaspberryPi components as well as the usual mix of w-Intel, Android and iOS systems).
