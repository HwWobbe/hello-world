# hello-world
Just a preliminary comment ... 
... AboutMe:  I use TiddlyWiki a lot!

Current (novice) issues ...
* I've noticed that I can edit this content directly, but when I try to use the GitHub GUI, I seem to get a version that is out-of-date.
* Make sure to use local versions that sync (in case of CloudLoss)
* Test (just) text.

Perhaps I should choose the Branch ... Merge ... PR work flow (instead of doing direct edits).

* Step through the tutorial again, making careful procedure notes
* Later it will be time to start setting up some repositories for my TW files.
* But one initial hurdle is which Git desktop version that syncs back, to choose.
* Check StackOverflow too

For the moment ...

* I am making a few related notes in the wiki and I am watching the reports of my activity to ensure that I have an adequate understanding of how to work in this environment.
* I can edit the Master, but seem to be having a bit of trouble creating a new Branch.
