This "Hello-world" repo(sitory) started VERY slowly with just my activities at GitHub.  Now, it is progressing as I consider it as a personal portal for more of my internet activities, as well as my rapidly growing intranet (that now includes RaspberryPi components as well as the usual mix of w-Intel, Android and iOS systems).
