# hello-world
Just a preliminary comment ... AboutMe:  I use TiddlyWiki a lot!

Now it's time to start setting up some repositories for my TW files.
But one initial hurdle is which Git desktop version that syncs back, to choose.


For the moment ...

I am making a few related notes in the wiki and I am watching the reports of my activity to ensure that I have an adequate understanding of how to work in this environment.
