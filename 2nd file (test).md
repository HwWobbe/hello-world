<h3> GitHub </h3>
Perhaps I should choose the Branch ... Merge ... PR work flow (instead of doing direct edits).

* I perform weekly Commits, if only to force focused attention and serve as an activity indicator.
* I am beginning to realize the importance of extending this GitHub profile towards my goal of providing a central, reliable comprehensive introduction
* Step through the tutorial again, making careful procedure notes
* I've noticed I can edit this content directly, but when I try to use the GitHub GUI, I get a version that is out-of-date.
* But one initial hurdle is which Git desktop version that syncs back, to choose.
* Later it will be time to start setting up some repositories for my TW files.

* Looking to spawn a new branch that I can then merge via a PR.
* That seems to be an Option of the commit process.
